# **CMSC341**
This is a composition of the school projects I completed for my CMSC341 course.

I'll also share my thoughts on what I thought about each project and what I learned from each one as well.

## **Project 0: Memory Management and Using GL**
This was the basic first project to get everyone re-acclimated with the learning environment, but it was also a test on our current knowledge of memory management when tasked to implement a templated Queue class. 

Though the project itself was not difficult as it was only a few functions to implement, it was a good chance to test my skills and also get used to using the external tools for memory checking, such as Valgrind.

## **Project 1: List of Sparse Matrices**
The project was to make a Linked List object that held a Compressed Sparse Matrix object (CSR object). It was interesting to have to do research on the topic and then apply it to a program that could be used. 

It was challenging as this was the first time I had to implement a data structure to a real life application problem. I learned a lot on the structure of CSRs and how to interact between a pseudo 3d object as I had the CSR containing a broken down matrix and then turduckening them all into a Linked List.
